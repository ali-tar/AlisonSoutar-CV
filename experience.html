      <h2>Industry and Work experience</h2>
      <p>As I am still a graduate, my work experience is limited as I focused my formative years on academia and 'growing up'. Although I have a modest list of work experience, I am eager to learn and develop from new opportunities and workplaces.</p>

      <p><strong>2022</strong></p>
      <p><em><strong>MakeReign</strong> - Intern</em></p>
      <div class="description">
        <p>During my Advanced Diploma at Red & Yellow, we would often have live briefs with real UX/UI Design and Developer companies.
          One of the companies we worked with was MakeReign. I enjoyed the logical feedback and briefing sessions with the MakeReign team,
          and applied as an intern during my studies. Recognising me for my work on their live brief, they accepted my application.</p>
        
        <p>MakeReign is a prototyping and user experience design agency. I spent majority of my internship sitting in on client briefs and learning 
            industry tools and standards.</p>

      <p><strong>2023</strong></p>
      <p><em><strong>TH_RST</strong> - Bartender</em></p>
      <div class="description">
        <p>I picked up a part-time bartending job for some extra income whilst applying for full-time positions and learning new skills.
        Although not directly translatable to the development and design industry, it has taught me how to operate quickly and efficently under immense pressure.
        Additionally, I have greatly improved my people skills. I am able to communicate clearly and concisely with my co-workers, in addition to
        being attentive to a customer's needs. Additionally, it has taught me how to listen closely to what a client wants to be able to 
        deliver a satisfying product.</p>

        <p><strong>2023</strong></p>
        <p><em><strong>Red & Yellow Creative School of Business</strong> - Tutor</em></p>
      <div class="description">
        <p>After completing my advanced diploma for User Centered Design (UX/UI), I was offered a tutoring position for students attending the course for the following year.
          In being a tutor, I was able to learn how others view problems and the best ways to explain possible solutions and outcomes to different people.
          Additionally, this allowed me to grapple with the content from an entirely new perspective - further solidifying my knowledge gained during this year of study.
