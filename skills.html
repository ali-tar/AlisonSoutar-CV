        <h2>UX/UI</h2>
        <p>Skills I picked up during my post-graduate advanced diploma at Red & Yellow. I gained a plethora of practical experience and perfected my flow within a team.</p>
        <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
          <h3>Researching & Data Collection</h3>
            <p>I learned how to properly identify a client's needs through evaluating their behaviour.
            One is able to learn more from observing how a client interacts with a product than from 
            merely interviewing them. During this academic year, we were tasked with a research project on a topic of our choosing.
            Part 1, the research portion, of this document can be viewed <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/175683313/Case-Study-(IM)PULSE-User-Research-Proposal" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p>I made avid use of the following methods to conduct my user research and collect my findings:</p>
            <div class="skill-grid">
              <p>User Observation</p>
              <p>Background research</p>

          <h3>Designing & Prototyping</h3>
            <p>The second portion of my postgraduate studies concerns the design and creation of prototypes. This is where we learned the value
              in iterative prototyping to ensure a product will be well-received by users. I have learned how to design
              ergonomic and user-friendly interfaces that are simple yet unique - accomplishing their goals and keeping users happy
              and well-informed.
              The the practical aspect of my year-long case study can be read <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/176063439/Case-Study-(IM)PULSE-Specifications-Interface-Design" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p>I use a mixture of the following principles to refine my prototypes:</p>

      <h2>Systems Design</h2>
      <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
        <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
          <p>My Computer Science 
            undergraduate ensured I would be familiar with common design patterns. This means I am considerate of safe, efficent and reusable
            ways to implement code. We focused on the Gang of Four (GoF) patterns 
            in particular. I am situationally aware
            of when to draw inspiration from each design pattern, and what the 
            strengths and weaknesses of certain design systems are. I am aware 
            of the necessity to abstract responsibilities
            in order to increaase the longevity of code.</p>
          <p>Some of the GoF design patterns I am familiar with are:</p>
          <div class="skill-grid" style="grid-template-rows: repeat(1,1fr);">
            <p>Singleton</p>
            <p>Factory</p> 
            <p>Observer</p> 
            <p>State</p> 
          </div>
      </div>   
      
      <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
        <h3>Architectural Patterns</h3>
          <p>In addition to understanding design pattern theory, I was also 
            taught the impostance of architectural patterns: the blueprint of a 
            piece of software's architecture. This skill has allowed me to 
            understand the reasoning behind certain builds as well as identify
            common architectural solution types to recurring problems. During
            my undergraduate, I became familiar with:</p>
          <div class="skill-grid" style="grid-template-rows: repeat(2,1fr);">
            <p>Layered architectural</p>
            <p>Model-View-Controller</p>
            <p>Client-Server</p>
            <p>Pipe-Filter</p>
            <p>Event-Driven</p>   
          </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
        <h3>Unified Modelling Language (UML)</h3>
          <p>In my undergraduate at University of Cape Town, I took a module in Information Systems. 
          Here I learned how to design functional systems as well as how to communicate this design to fellow developers and the UX/UI team. I learned several key diagram schematics, 
          when to use them, why they're useful and what they're best used for. This means I am able to accurately communicate
          design suggestions, as well as accurately understand design solutions suggested by team members. Additionally, this has made
          me aware of the importance of elegantly designed solutions and the importance of clear communication between
          members of a development team, those in different departments as well as the client.
          A few of UML diagrams I created during this course can be viewed             <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/148584703/UML-Architectural-Portfolio" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
          <p>I became well-versed in creating and interpreting:</p>
          <div class="skill-grid">
            <p>Class diagrams</p>   
            <p>Package diagrams</p>   
            <p>User experience maps</p>   
            <p>Use case diagrams</p>
            <p>State-Machine diagrams</p>   
            <p>Site maps</p>   
            <p>Activity flows</p>   
            <p>Information architecture</p>   
            <p>Class diagrams</p>
            <p>Value propositions</p>   
            <p>Sequence diagrams</p>   
            <p>Composition diagrams</p>

          <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical large">
            <h4>Threading</h4>
            <p>I am familiar with threading implementation, as well as several methods used to prevent 
              deadlock such as semophores, wait() and hold() methods, mutual exclusion, etc. Additionally, 
              I am aware of the threat of deadlock and attempt to code in a way that actively avoids it. 
              I am also familair with resource allocation and related theory.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical large ">
            <h4>Encapsulation, SOLID and Security</h4>
            <p>With reference to design patterns, I am aware of the necessity to ensure code
               is reusable. I am familiar with SOILD principles and strive to create classes 
               with single-responsibilities that 
              can be switched in and out as needed, and worked on as required. Additionally, 
              I am aware of Code Smell and security hazzards as a result of poor coding practise.</p>
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical large">
            <h4>Data structures</h4>
            <div>
              <p>I learned several key methods of data storing as well as their computational complexity. I 
                learned the pros and cons of several key data structures, as well as how to implement them.
                This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                <div class="skill-grid" style="grid-template-rows: repeat(2,3fr);"">
                  <p>AVL, Binary, Red-Black, etc Trees.</p>  
                  <p>Hash tables and Hash maps</p>
                  <p>Arrays and ArrayLists</p> 
                  <p>SQL and Query operations</p>
                  <p>Text files and String manipulation</p>
                  <p>Theoretical structures of physical machines</p>
                </div> 
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical large ">
            <h4>Efficency</h4>
            <div>
              <p>I am aware of the importance of computational complexity and aim to make my code as resource effective 
                as possible. I am aware of different possible solutions and their numeral Big O complexities. I know when
                 it is important to prioritise speed and when it may not be needed. 
                Additionally, I have experience working with popular sorting algorithms such as: </p>
                <div class="skill-grid" style="grid-template-rows: repeat(2,3fr);"">
                  <p>Mergesort</p>
                  <p>Bubblesort</p>  
                  <p>Binary search</p>
                  <p>Quicksort</p>
                  <p>Insertion sort</p>
                  <p>Breadth-first sort</p>
                </div>

      <h2>Front-end Development</h2>
      <p>Although my undergraduate degree focused largely on back-end principles, I took it upon myself to learn front-end
         languages to align myself and my career with my passion for creation and design. However, I am still a beginner: 
         but I believe I hold great potential to excel in this feild.</p>

      <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
        <h4>HTML & CSS</h4>
        <p>Although still in the fundamental phase of front-end knowledge,
          I ensure I stick to conventionl practise in order to make my code
          readable and expandable. I ensure my HTML is purely for structure,
          allowing for easy updating of style within the dedicated CSS file.
          In doing so, I ensure that updates only need to be made in one area - 
          thereby minimising the risk of inconsistency. </p>
