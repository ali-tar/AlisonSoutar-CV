        <h2>UX/UI</h2>
        <p>Skills I picked up during my post-graduate advanced diploma at Red & Yellow. I gained a plethora of practical experience and perfected my flow within a team.</p>
        <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
          <h3>Researching & Data Collection</h3>
            <p style="padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%;">I learned how to properly identify a client's needs through evaluating their behaviour.
            One is able to learn more from observing how a client interacts with a product than from 
            merely interviewing them. During this academic year, we were tasked with a research project on a topic of our choosing.
            Part 1, the research portion, of this document can be viewed <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/175683313/Case-Study-(IM)PULSE-User-Research-Proposal" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p>I made avid use of the following methods to conduct my user research and collect my findings:</p>
            <div class="skill-grid">
              <p>User Observation</p>
              <p>Background research</p>

          <h3>Designing & Prototyping</h3>
            <p style="padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%;">The second portion of my postgraduate studies concerns the design and creation of prototypes. This is where we learned the value
              in iterative prototyping to ensure a product will be well-received by users. I have learned how to design
              ergonomic and user-friendly interfaces that are simple yet unique - accomplishing their goals and keeping users happy
              and well-informed.
              The the practical aspect of my year-long case study can be read <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/176063439/Case-Study-(IM)PULSE-Specifications-Interface-Design" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p>I use a mixture of the following principles to refine my prototypes:</p>
            <div class="skill-grid">
              <p>Card sorting</p>
              <p>Rainbow charts</p>
              <p>Sitemap evaluation</p>
              <p>Insight-grouping</p>
              <p>A/B testing</p>
              <p>Iterative prototyping</p>

      <h2>Systems Design</h2>
      <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
        <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
          <p style="padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%;">My Computer Science undergraduate ensured I would be familiar with common design patterns. This means I am considerate of safe, efficent and reusable
            ways to implement code. We focused on the Gang of Four (GoF) patterns in particular. I am situationally aware
            of when to draw inspiration from each design pattern, and what the strengths and weaknesses of certain design systems are. I am aware of the necessity to abstract responsibilities
            in order to increaase the longevity of code.</p>
          <p>Some of the GoF design patterns I am familiar with are:</p>
          <div class="skill-grid">
            <p>Singleton</p>
            <p>Factory</p> 
            <p>Observer</p> 
            <p>State</p> 
          </div>
      </div>   
      
      <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
        <h3>Architectural Patterns</h3>
          <p>In addition to understanding design pattern theory, I was also taught the impostance of architectural patterns: the blueprint of a 
            piece of software's architecture. This skill has allowed me to understand the reasoning behind certain builds as well as identify
            common architectural solution types to recurring problems. During my undergraduate, I became familiar with:</p>
          <div class="skill-grid" style="grid-template-rows: repeat(2,1fr);">
            <p>Layered architectural</p>
            <p>Model-View-Controller</p>
            <p>Client-Server</p>
            <p>Pipe-Filter</p>
            <p>Event-Driven</p>   
          </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
        <h3>Unified Modelling Language (UML)</h3>
          <p style="padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%;">In my undergraduate at University of Cape Town, I took a module in Information Systems. 
          Here I learned how to design functional systems as well as how to communicate this design to fellow developers and the UX/UI team. I learned several key diagram schematics, 
          when to use them, why they're useful and what they're best used for. This means I am able to accurately communicate
          design suggestions, as well as accurately understand design solutions suggested by team members. Additionally, this has made
          me aware of the importance of elegantly designed solutions and the importance of clear communication between
          members of a development team, those in different departments as well as the client.
          A few of UML diagrams I created during this course can be viewed             <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/148584703/UML-Architectural-Portfolio" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
          <p>I became well-versed in creating and interpreting:</p>
          <div class="skill-grid">
            <p>Class diagrams</p>   
            <p>Package diagrams</p>   
            <p>User experience maps</p>   
            <p>Use case diagrams</p>
            <p>State-Machine diagrams</p>   
            <p>Site maps</p>   
            <p>Activity flows</p>   
            <p>Information architecture</p>   
            <p>Class diagrams</p>
            <p>Value propositions</p>   
            <p>Sequence diagrams</p>   
            <p>Composition diagrams</p>

          <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
            <h4>Threading</h4>
            <p>I am familiar with threading implementation, as well as several methods used to prevent deadlock such as semophores, wait() and hold() methods, mutual exclusion, etc. Additionally, I am aware of the threat of deadlock and attempt to code in a way that actively avoids it.</p>

          <div class="card-aesthetic dynamic vertical">
            <h4>Data structures</h4>
            <p>I learned several key methods of data storing as well as their computational complexity. I learned the pros and cons of several key data structures, as well as how to implement them.
              This includes, but is not limited to:
              <div class="skill-grid">
